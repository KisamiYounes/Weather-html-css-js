I see your project has three main files:

* **index.html** → the main HTML structure
* **master.css** → styling for the app
* **main.js** → JavaScript functionality

Here’s a clean `README.md` file for your project:

Do you want me to open the **`main.js`** file and confirm which API/service it uses so I can adjust the README accordingly?
